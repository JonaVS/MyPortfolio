You know, ever since I was little I've been very curious about tech things, being this the main reason that later prompted me in my elementary school and high school journey to interact and be more aware of these kinds of topics, especially the ones related to computers. Later, when the time for picking a career came, I decided to enroll in computer science, career that I took at Universidad Estatal a Distancia (UNED),  obtaining my first degree.",
